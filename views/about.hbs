					<p>Hi! I am Stephen, a current 3rd semester computer programming student at Seneca College. <br>The program is teaching me amazing things, such as how to become a MEAN stack web developer. 
                    <br>Apart from learning <i>JavaScript</i>, I also thoroughly enjoy programming with <i>C++</i>!<br> On my spare time, I am usually reading and testing new methods to code, or
                    working part-time as a flair bartender.</p>
                    <p> I hope you enjoy browsing my web app, and if you have any questions you can contact me at: <a href="mailto:sward15@myseneca.ca">my e-mail.</a></p>
